In the meadow where the wind whispers,
I find a silence that lingers.
The sun bows down, kisses the earth,
As if to say, "Here's another birth."

Sky and sea in a distant embrace,
Unite at the horizon, a sacred place.
Stars above spell tales untold,
In the dark night, secrets unfold.

I'm but a dot in this cosmic scheme,
Yet, in my heart, I dare to dream.
For in each beat, and each little thing,
Lies the miracle that makes life sing.
